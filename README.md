# 📱 AwesomeProject02 - React Native UI Showcase

This is my second React Native project built using **Expo** and **TypeScript**, showcasing various card components and UI interactions with clean styling and functionality. It’s designed to demonstrate real-world mobile UI components, links, and navigation experiences.

## 🚀 What I Built

### 🔸 1. **Simple Flat Cards**

Basic UI cards with static content to demonstrate foundational component layout.

### 🔸 2. **Horizontally Scrollable Cards**

A horizontally scrollable view of colorful cards showing flexibility and responsive layout.

### 🔸 3. **Famous Places Cards**

Stylized cards representing popular locations. This section focuses on layout — no interaction included (static design).

### 🔸 4. **Fancy Cards with “Read More”**

Dynamic cards showing blog previews or article summaries.

- ✅ Includes a **“Read More”** button
- 🔗 When clicked, it opens an external **website/blog link**

### 🔸 5. **Contact List (WhatsApp UI Inspired)**

Custom-styled contact list resembling WhatsApp UI.

- 🧑 When a **user taps on a contact’s name**, it opens the person’s **Instagram profile** via external linking.
